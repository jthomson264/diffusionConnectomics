#  First, check if the model has already been fit.  Do this by searching for the 
#  output, which should have been sent to the next step.  If it has been fit,
#  leave this script, and cat the line to finishedQueue.txt

#  Next, check if the prerequisite steps have been completed.  There are none for this,
#  so this is left blank.  If there were, and they were not completed, exit the script.
#  They should complete on the next run of completeQueue on the upstream server.

#  Now, since the command has not yet run, and we are ready to run it, run the command.
