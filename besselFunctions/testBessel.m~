%  This is a script to test my power series expansion approximation of the modified 
%  bessel function of the first kind.

%  It's going to walk through orders 0, 1, 2, and then generate some ricians (with 
%  sigma forced at one, like my xi and lambda variables), and test how the real bessel
%  differs from my approximation for their product.
