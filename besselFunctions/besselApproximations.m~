function [y] = besselApproximation(order, x, approxOrder)

  %%  This function computes approximations of the modified bessel function of the
  %%  first kind.  The approximations are taken from

  %%  We use the power series expansion.  An asymptotic form is available that we eschew
  %%  becuase it requires large x.
