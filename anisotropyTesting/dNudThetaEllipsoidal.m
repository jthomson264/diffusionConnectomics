function [ dnudtheta ] = dNudThetaEllipsoidal( Xs, btab, sigmas, Nus, theta )
%Compute the partial derivative.  This is the qqT we talked about.  Note this does not include the lagrangian terms.   
%   Note: given that you have Xs, btab, sigmas, and theta, you don't
%   necessarily need to pass Nus.
