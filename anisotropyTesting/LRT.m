function [ Pval ] = LRT( M1, M2 )
% Likelihood Ratio Test.
%   Input is two model objects.  These are structs with two members.
%       M.loglikelihood is a loglikelihood.  
%       M.dof is the degrees of freedom of the model.
%   The LRT is reasonably simple and you should find all the required
%   details either in Rob's book or on Wikipedia.
